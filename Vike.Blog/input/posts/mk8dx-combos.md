Version 2.3.0 of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe was released on March 9th, 2023. 
With this change came wave 4 of the Booster Course Pass including 8 new tracks, a new playable character, and a sleuth of statistic changes to characters, vehicle bodies, and tires.
This post will cover all the changes that were made, some discussion about what each of the stats actually mean, and how you can use that to choose the combination you will use online.

## What changed?
A common criticism of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is that if you were to play online you would be facing a room full of Waluigis.
Before 2.3.0, Waluigi was by far the best character to use online because it allowed you to have a good balance of speed, weight, and acceleration.
Over the last three waves of the Booster Course Pass, Nintendo has made significant balance changes which appear to have been done to address this criticism and level the playing field.

- In version 2.1.0, Nintendo made it so that having a larger weight was not as significant as it was before.  
- In version 2.2.0, Nintendo added a new statistic that changed the time that you are invincible from damage after being hit. The worst invincibility value was given to Waluigi.  
- In version 2.3.0, Nintendo increased the speed and mini-turbo stats of various characters, vehicle bodies, and tires by 0.25.

The changes in version 2.3.0 were the most significant and were enough to mean that Waluigi is no longer the best character to use.
Because these buffs affect three different aspects of a combination, it means that some combinations have gotten much better.
Someone using Mario, Standard Kart, and Standard Tires has now gotten an additional 0.25 Speed and 0.75 Mini-Turbo with this update.

Below is a brief summary of all the buffs that were made:
- All characters **except** Waluigi, Donkey Kong, Roy, Wario, Dry Bowser, Metal Mario, Pink Gold Peach, Bowser, Morton, and Mii (Heavy) received +0.25 Speed.
- Baby Mario, Baby Luigi, Dry Bones, Mii (Light), Toad, Shy Guy, Larry, Peach, Daisy, Yoshi, Mario, Ludwig, Mii (Medium), Luigi, and Iggy all received +0.25 Mini-Turbo
- All bodies **except** Biddybuggy, Mr. Scooty, Landship, Streetle, W 25 Silver Arrow, Standard Bike, Flame Rider, and Wild Wiggler received +0.25 Mini-Turbo
- All tires **except** Roller, Azure Roller, Button, and Leaf received +0.25 Mini-Turbo

All the parts that received buffs were ones that were not commonly used when playing online, and with these stat increases there are many more viable combinations that can be used.

## What do the stats mean?
To help with explaining how to choose your combination, below is a summary of each statistic type and how it translates to gameplay.
Each statistic has a value between 0.75 to 5.75, and can be viewed in-game by pressing the plus button when selecting your vehicle.
Some of the statistics are not viewable in-game such as Mini-Turbo, Invincibility, and the Air, Water, and Anti-Gravity parts of the speed and handling stats.
To see these hidden statistics you can use a site such as [mk8dxbuilder.com](https://mk8dxbuilder.com/).

### Speed
Speed is the top speed that you can reach. It also affects your speed when in a mushroom or a mini-turbo.
Each combination has 4 speed stats: Ground, Air, Water, and Anti-Gravity which affect your top speed in each of those conditions.
When you are not at your top speed, the speed stat has no impact and instead your current speed will be determined solely by your acceleration.
Turning in Mario Kart reduces your speed, which means that the more turns a track has, the less relevant the speed stat is.
If you are using a character with low speed, you can overcome the speed limitations by maximising the amount of time you are in a mini-turbo.

### Acceleration
Acceleration affects how quickly your speed increases.
When you are at your top speed, acceleration has no impact.
For the same reason, using a mushroom, entering a mini-turbo, or being in a star also means acceleration has no impact.
If you are using a character with low acceleration, you will want to do very simple lines and drive straight as often as possible.

### Weight
Weight affects how far you get pushed away when bumping into another player. 
Weight has no impact on time trials but is important in online play as bumps can be quite severe and cause you to miss item boxes or be pushed off the track.

### Handling
Handling affects how fast you can turn. 
While drifting this changes how tight or wide you can make your drift. 
Just like the speed stat, handling is also represented using 4 different stats: Ground, Air, Water, and Anti-Gravity which affect your handling in each of those conditions.
Having higher handling is very useful for online play where you need to be able to adapt to all sorts of scenarios such as adjusting your drift to avoid an item.
It is also useful in TTs for tracks which have tight or wide turns.

### Traction
Traction affects how quickly you lose speed when off-road and the relative maximum speed you have off-road.
If you are on the road the entire time you are driving then traction has no effect.
There are a number of shortcuts in the game which require you to drive or hop off-road, for example the shortcut at the start of Mario Kart Stadium needs you to drive on top of the grass and release a mini-turbo.
Having higher traction makes doing these shortcuts easier since you will have more room to finish building any MTs and a larger window of time that you can hop without losing your
Having high traction can also be useful for online play if you are recovering from driving off-road.

### Mini-Turbo
Mini-Turbo affects how quickly you are able to accumulate build up mini-turbos, and how long they last once you release them.
For more information about how to calculate the time needed to accumulate an MT, refer to my [drifting guide](/drifting-guide#mt-accumulation) which goes into more detail.

### Invincibility
Invincibility controls the amount of time you are invincible after getting hit by something.
This has no impact on time trials, but can be useful in online play.
As an example, if you were hit by a bomb, then an invincibility stat of 1 means you will be invincible for 0.97 seconds after recovering, while an invincibility stat of 5.75 will be invincible for 2.25 seconds after recovering.

### Other differences
Aside from stats, there are a few other things that separate different combinations apart from each other:
- Hitbox
  - The hitbox of a combination can vary even if they have identical stats
  - Having a larger hitbox means you don't have to drift as wide to get a coin and you can hang more over an edge without falling off
  - Having a smaller hitbox means you can avoid items easier and you can get closer to a wall without bumping it
- Drifting Style
  - Every vehicle body is one of 4 types: Kart (e.g. Biddybuggy), Standard Bike (e.g. Mr. Scooty), Sport Bike (e.g. Yoshi Bike), and ATV (e.g. Wild Wiggler)
  - Sport bikes (commonly known as inward bikes) are the most notably different, however the other three types have very subtle differences in how they drift
  - The differences between the outward drifting vehicle types are difficult to explain, but their turning circles when drifting vary slightly.
    Standard bikes have the most noticeable difference as when you start a drift it tends to go out very wide compared to karts and ATVs.
- Popularity
  - If you are playing in a competitive match in a team, you will want to identify easily which players are on your team and which players are not. If everyone is using the same character, then you can only do this by communicating with your team in a call or by keeping track of all the player names around you.
  - If you are playing as a character that no-one else is playing as, then it means all the people on the other teams can easily tell you are an enemy, but it also means that your teammates can easily tell who you are and can see where you are on the mini-map which can be useful when figuring out when to use lightning.

## How to choose a combination
Rather than choosing one combination and sticking with it, your combination should change and evolve over time according to your playstyle.
- If you are getting bumped around too much, try a combination with higher weight.
- If you are struggling to get the mini-turbos you want, try a combination with higher mini-turbo.
- If you are doing better on tracks that have lots of turns and worse on tracks that have less turns, try a combination with higher speed and less acceleration.
- If you find that you are getting hit by too many items and struggle to catch up, use a combination with higher acceleration or invincibility.

When you make these kinds of changes, you are going to have to make a trade-off and get a worse stat in some other place. 
If you want more speed, you will likely have to sacrifice your acceleration.
Experiment using time trials and online play to see if these sacrifices are worth it.
Sometimes to use a combination that has higher acceleration and lower speed, you need to learn new lines to take advantage of that.
To learn new lines, I would recommend reading my [blog post on how to learn lines](/posts/learning-lines).

### How to find new combinations to experiment with
Knowing that you want more of a stat is one thing, but finding such a combination while minimising the number of sacrifices you have to make is another.
Currently there are 43 characters (with 5 more on the way), 41 vehicle bodies, 22 tires, and 15 gliders to choose from meaning 649,440 possible combinations to choose from.
Trying every one of these combinations is impractical, so I have made a [tool](/tools/mk8dx-combo-finder) that lets you search for combinations with the stats that you want.
The tool is just a table of all the combinations and their values, but each column has filter options that you can set so that you can filter the table down to only show the rows which match their filters.
Since the table is quite wide, you can drag to rearrange the columns to put the ones you care about first.

To run a quick example, say that you are currently using Waluigi, Wild Wiggler, Roller, and Cloud Glider and you want something with more acceleration, and you are willing to sacrifice some speed and weight to get it.
We know this combination has a speed of 3.5, acceleration of 4.25, and a weight of 3.
Using the tool, we can find all combinations with an acceleration >= 4.5, speed >= 3.25, and weight >= 2.75.
After applying these filters, we can see there are 16 combinations that fit the criteria which we can look through and choose the best one.
If we don't like these options, then we know we need to sacrifice more and we could change it to show all combinations with speed >= 3 instead.

### What is a good starter combination for me to try out?
If you are new to the game and are still learning your lines, you are likely to be making many mistakes, and drifting in ways that cause you to lose speed, so you will benefit a lot from good acceleration and handling stats. 
For this, I'd recommend looking for something with speed >= 2.25, acceleration >= 5, and handling >= 4.5. 
One combination that meets these requirements is Yoshi, Biddybuggy, Roller, Cloud Glider. 

As you get more experience, you may not need to be as reliant on acceleration to make up for mistakes and can look for combinations with speed >= 3, acceleration >= 4.25, handling >= 3.5, and Mini-Turbo >= 4.25. 
For this, you will find hundreds of options and you can decide which of these stats you want to increase to filter it down further.
One combination that meets these requirements is Rosalina, Teddy Buggy, Roller, Cloud Glider.
